# Hide-a-folder-or-file-in-windows

This is a sample c program to hide files/folder in windows using `command prompt` in the compilation.
If you run this using the powershell this program might not run due to certain commands in powershell.
But you may take the knowlegde and change it according to powershell.

## Note:

 - this was developed using codeblocks and cmd. 
Thank you!
